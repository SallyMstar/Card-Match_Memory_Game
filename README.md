## Instructions
The goal of this memory game is to finish as quickly as possible with as few errors as possible.  For every 4 misses, you will lose one star.  Once all your stars are gone, the game is over and you may restart to try again.

## Contributing
The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. My task was to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

The images used on the cards are compliments of Font Awesome, the shuffle function comes from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976, and the starter code and guidelines are from Udacity.

Thank you for choosing to play!
