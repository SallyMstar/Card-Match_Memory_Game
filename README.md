## Instructions
The goal of this memory game is to finish as quickly as possible with as few errors as possible.  For every 4 misses, you will lose one star.  Once all your stars are gone, the game is over and you may restart to try again.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

Thank you for choosing to play!
